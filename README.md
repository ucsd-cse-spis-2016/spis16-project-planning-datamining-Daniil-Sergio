We plan to build a website that takes data from a survey and matches people together based on their responses. We plan to take a survey of our current SPIS students, take their data into a dictionary with lists as values and their names as Keys. With that, we wil do the following: Create a program that returns the names of 5 other SPISers that have similar responses, create a function that takes two SPISers as paramaters and returns their compatability rating, and, time permitting, other functions.
